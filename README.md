# Movie's genre classification

**Please refer to (paper) for detail explanation**

In this project, both acoustic and visual feature of the movie is used to classify the multi-label movie's genre. The network defined for genre classification based on frames is shown below. The final class is decided by feeding the fusion of audio and visual features into the SVM model.
